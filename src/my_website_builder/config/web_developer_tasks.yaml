  description: >
    Create a complete, production-ready single-file webpage for the given module.

    Inputs provided to you:
    - module_name: the name of the file to generate.
    - components: a structured list of UI components that must be implemented.
    - instruction: additional functional or design constraints.

    Your responsibilities:

    1) File Generation:
       - Produce ONE single self-contained HTML file.
       - Include full HTML structure: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>.
       - All CSS must be inside <style> tags.
       - All JavaScript must be inside <script> tags.
       - Do not create multiple files.
       - Do not require build tools or npm packages.
       - CDN libraries (e.g., Tailwind, Google Fonts, icons) are allowed.
       - The file represents: output/{module_name}.html

    2) UI & Design Requirements:
       - The design must be modern, clean, and responsive.
       - Must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
       - Use proper spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.
       - Provide good UX:
         • loading states
         • empty states
         • error messages
         • smooth transitions where appropriate

    3) Component Implementation:
       - Every component listed in {components} must be fully implemented.
       - No placeholders unless explicitly required.
       - Forms must validate inputs.
       - Buttons must trigger meaningful actions.
       - Lists/tables must dynamically update.
       - Modals must open and close correctly.
       - Filters/search must actually filter data.

    4) JavaScript Architecture:
       - Organize code clearly inside the file:
         • Application State
         • UI Rendering Functions
         • Event Handlers
         • Mock API Layer (async functions returning JSON)
         • Utility Functions
       - Simulate backend calls using async functions.
       - Keep mock endpoints structured so they can be replaced by real APIs.
       - Maintain clean separation between UI logic and data logic.

    5) Code Quality:
       - Clean indentation and readable structure.
       - Avoid duplicated logic.
       - No unnecessary components beyond {components}.
       - Keep logic modular and maintainable.

    Output Constraints:
       - Return only HTML code
       - Do NOT add explanations.
       - Do NOT use markdown fences.
       - The first line must be: <!DOCTYPE html>
       - The file represents: {module_name}

  expected_output: >
    A single fully functional self-contained HTML file named {module_name}.html
    The file named save should not have any space in betwwen words. If there are, replace them with '_'. This is very very important
    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implemented according to the given components
    and instruction, ready for real-world use.
  agent: webpage_creator
  output_file: output/{module_name}.html
